/* Kata Level: 7.

 * Story:
 * Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again.
 * Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price.
 * Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.
 * 
 * Task:
 * Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.
 * 
 * Examples (Input --> Output) 
 * [1,2,3,4,5] --> [1,5]
 * [2334454,5] --> [5,2334454]
 * [1]         --> [1,1]
 * 
 * Remarks:
 * All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length.
 * Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.
