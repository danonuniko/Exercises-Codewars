Definition:
A number is called Automorphic number if and only if its square ends in the same digits as the number itself.

Task:
Given a number determine if it Automorphic or not.

Notes:
The number passed to the function is positive.

Input >> Output Examples:

autoMorphic (25) -->> return "Automorphic" 
Explanation: 25 squared is 625, ends with the same number's digits which are 25.

autoMorphic (13) -->> return "Not!!"
Explanation: 13 squared is 169, not ending with the same number's digits which are 69.
