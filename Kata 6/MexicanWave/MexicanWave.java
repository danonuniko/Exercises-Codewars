/* Kata Level: 6.
 * 
 * Introduction:
 * The wave (known as the Mexican wave in the English-speaking world outside North America) 
 * is an example of metachronal rhythm achieved in a packed stadium when successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell, and raise their arms.
 * Immediately upon stretching to full height, the spectator returns to the usual seated position.
 * 
 * The result is a wave of standing spectators that travels through the crowd, even though individual spectators never move away from their seats.
 * In many large arenas the crowd is seated in a contiguous circuit all the way around the sport field, 
 * and so the wave is able to travel continuously around the arena; in discontiguous seating arrangements, the wave can instead reflect back and forth through the crowd. 
 * When the gap in seating is narrow, the wave can sometimes pass through it. 
 * Usually only one wave crest will be present at any given time in an arena, although simultaneous, counter-rotating waves have been produced.
 * 
 * Task:
 * In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave.
 * You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up. 
 * 
 * Rules:
 * 
 * 1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.
 * 2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]
 * Good luck and enjoy!
