Kata Level: 6.

The Hamming Distance is a measure of similarity between two strings of equal length. 
Complete the function so that it returns the number of positions where the input strings do not match.

Examples:

a = "I like turtles"
b = "I like turkeys"
Result: 3

a = "Hello World"
b = "Hello World"
Result: 0

a = "espresso"
b = "Expresso"
Result: 2

You can assume that the two input strings are of equal length.
